</div>


<p>Now that we've seen how the innards of your computer work, let's shift gears a bit and discuss everyone's favorite way to procrastinate: the Internet. So... what <em>is</em> the Internet? It's been described as <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/8nj7ho/internet-is-a-series-of-tubes">a series of tubes</a>, but the Internet is really a huge network of connected computers. Using the Internet, your machine can contact another machine, like the one powering cnn.com, in order to share information. However, there's a pretty good chance that your computer doesn't have a wire running to the computer cnn.com runs on. Instead, your request to cnn.com will likely be routed through several other machines in order to reach its destination.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at how my request to cnn.com actually gets there. To do that, I'm going to open up a Terminal and use a program called <code>traceroute</code>, which makes a request to song destination on the Internet and displays each machine it visits on the way there. Here's what happened when I ran it from a computer living in Newark, New Jersey (where Snooki is my dedicated system administrator). Before you ask, yes, I do indeed name my computers after characters from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox_(series)">Star Fox</a>.</p>

<p><img src="img/6-trace-cnn.png" alt="Traceroute to CNN.com" /></p>

<p>Each one of these rows represents a machine that my request to CNN.com went through. The first of these rows is my computer, where the request originated from. Each of these devices is called a <strong>router</strong>, whose purpose in life is to route a request for information to the correct destination. While all of these routers may not know how to contact cnn.com, each does seem to have <em>some</em> idea of how to get there. Each device has its own <strong>routing table</strong>, which maps ranges of destination addresses to other connected routers; when my request for cnn.com reaches a router, that router will use its routing table to determine where my request should be sent next so it reaches its destination as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>In the first column, we can see how many "hops" it took our request to reach each router. Next, we can see something that looks like an identifier for each device. From this output, it looks like our request started in Newark and then passed through Washington and Atlanta before reaching its final destination. The stars on row 14 simply indicate that that particular machine is choosing not to disclose any information about itself, for one reason or another. In the next column, we see each device's <strong>IP address</strong>, or a unqiue and identifying series of numbers, that can be used to contact the router. Finally, we can see how long it took from our request to get from the Jersey Shore to that machine. Based on this output, it took less than 20 milliseconds for my request to travel all the way to Atlanta, Georgia!</p>

<p>You may also have heard the term "router" while setting up your home Internet. In general, a router is used to create a <strong>network</strong>, which is simply a set of connected computers. Several computers can be physically wired to a router, and many modern routers also allow devices to connect to the network wirelessly. In your home, your router is likely attached to a DSL or cable modem, which establishes a connection via a coaxial cable and data jack. An <strong>Internet Service Provider</strong>, or ISP, is then responsible for connecting you to the Internet. Large ISPs in the United States include Comcast and Verizon, whose service (or the service of one of their subsidiary companies) you may use in your own home!</p>

<p>Let's try another one. Here's the output of <code>traceroute</code> on a different destination, reddit.com. If unfamiliar with reddit, click <a href="http://reddit.com">here</a> to waste the next ten hours of your day.</p>

<p><img src="img/6-trace-reddit.png" alt="Traceroute to reddit.com" /></p>

<p>This one looks a bit different. Unlike the previous output, it doesn't look like we can immediately figure out where my request went. However, let's take a closer look at that second column again. Turns out that routers' are commonly identified using nearby airport abbreviations. A quick Google shows that "mmu" is New Jersey's Morristown Municipal Airport, "ewr" is the Newark Liberty International Airport, and "nyc" is New York City. Now, take a look at the times between hops 7 and 8; looks like our time jumped from 1 millisecond to 68 milliseconds! What happened there, are all those Yankees fans slowing down the Internet in New York? While that <em>could</em> be the case, it looks like the next router is located in the United Kingdom, the London Heathrow Airport to be precise! Unsurprisingly, it takes a while for my request to make like Columbus and traverse the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at that third column, the four numbers separated by dots. A device's IP address, much like your street address, describes a location to which other devices connected to the Internet can send messages. Each number in an IP address, called an <strong>octet</strong>, ranges from 0 to 255. So, how many bits is that? (Hint: why is it called an octet?) We know that with one bit we can represent all numbers &le; 1, with two bits numbers &le; 3, with three bits numbers &le; 7, and so on. Eventually, we'll find out that we can represent all numbers &le; 255 with exactly 8 bits. So, each octect in an IP address is 8 bits long, which means we have a total of 32 bits to work with. Hopefully that number rings a bell, as 32 bits is equal to one byte!</p>

<p>Because all IP addresses are simply four numbers between 0&ndash;255, that must mean that we only have a fixed number of them. To figure out how many, let's think about an IP address as a sequence of 32 bits. We know that each of those bits can be either a 0 or a 1, which gives us only two possibilities. Since there are 32 of them, that means that the total number of unique sequences of 0s and 1s is 2<sup>32</sup>, or 4,294,967,296. At first glance, four billion addresses seems like plenty. (If not, then your intuition is better than mine!) However, the current world population is currently pushing seven billion people. On top of that, I have three different Internet-connected devices into my pocket, which isn't uncommon in today's world. Finally, companies like Google have millions of different servers, each needing some kind of IP address. Suddenly, those four billion addresses don't seem like that many.</p>

<p>As an aside, this isn't the first (or last) time technology has outgrown existing infrastructure. Rumor has it that in 1981 Bill Gates was quoted as saying "640K of memory ought to be enough for anybody" to address concerns with memory limitations of an IBM computer. In the Internet's earliest days, thoughts of supporting over 4 billion interconnected devices probably weren't at the front of engineers' minds!</p>

<p>So if we're running out of IP addresses, what can we do? After all, without an IP address, a device cannot be contacted by other devices connected to the Internet. One solution is to simply increase the size of IP addresses, which would increase the total number of available addresses. The 32-bit IP address is known as <strong>IPv4</strong>, which was released in the early 1980s. Now, a standard known as <strong>IPv6</strong> is starting to gain momentum. While an IPv4 address looks something like 60.254.153.16, an IPv6 address is instead a series of hexadecimal digits like 2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334. Hexadecimal, like binary, simply represents numbers using a different base; while binary uses base 2, hexadecimal uses base 16. Since we only have 10 different digits to work with, hexadecimal uses "a" to represent the number 11, "b" to represent 12, and so on until "f" represents 15. Each hexadecimal digit is 4 bits, so IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length, which creates a total of 2<sup>128</sup> (or 3.4 &times; 10<sup>38</sup>) different addresses. To be precise, IPv6 allows 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 different IP addresses. For an always up-to-date count of how many IPv6 addresses are left in the world, check out <a href="http://samsclass.info/ipv6/exhaustion.htm">this website</a>. Assuming the world's population is about 7 billion people, that means we can have have 4.8 &times; 10<sup>28</sup> different IPv6 addresses <em>per person</em>. That's a whole lot of iPhones! Of course, the people behind IPv4 probably said something similar 30+ years ago...</p>

<p>The adoption of IPv6 has been slow but steady. June 6, 2012 was dubbed World IPv6 Launch, and major Internet companies were encouraged to finally enable IPv6 support once and for all. The event was even advertised with the tagline "this time, it's for real." About a quarter of the world's top 500 sites have IPv6 enabled, and about <a href="http://www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption">1% of Google users connect using IPv6</a>. However, Google does note that the number of IPv6 users has increased by a factor of 2 since last year, which is promising for IPv6 adoption.</p>

<p>Making addresses bigger isn't the only way we can conserve the IP address space. In fact, you probably don't need the laptop sitting on your kitchen table to be accessible by any other computer on the Internet (and or security reasons, you might not want this either, but more on that later). Because you don't need other machines on the Internet contacting your computer, there's no need to give it a unique, publically-accessible IP address. Your computer will indeed need some kind of IP address in order to connect to the Internet, but that's where a technology called <strong>NAT</strong>, or Network Address Translation comes in. Using NAT, the router connecting your home computer to the Internet can assign it a <strong>private</strong> IP address, or one that cannot be used by any ole' device on the Internet to reach your computer. Typically, private IP addresses take the form <code>10.x.y.z</code>, <code>172.16.y.z</code>, and <code>192.168.y.z</code>, which may look familiar if you've ever set up a home wireless network. Now, only your router has a single public IP address, while all of the devices on your home network have private IP addresses that don't take away from the pool of 2<sup>32</sup> IPv4 addresses!</p>

<p>But, this begs the question of how a computer with a private IP can interact with the Internet at all. After all, if I request information from cnn.com, then I'm probably expecting to receive some kind of response from my favorite news network, but CNN can't use my laptop's IP because it's private. Here's where the "T" in NAT kicks in. When my computer with a private IP address makes a request to a public IP address, it has to go through my router first, since that's what's connecting my computer to the Internet via my home network. Though my laptop doesn't have a public IP address, my router sure does. Once my request gets to the router, NAT will modify it so the request looks like it's coming from the router's public IP rather than my computer's private IP. After this slight modification, the router will happily forward it along to the next stop on its journey to CNN. In some cases, routers will actually have a pool of different IPs to choose from, but the same process applies to routers with just one IP address.</p>

<p>Eventually, Wolf Blitzer is going to receive my request and will want to send a response to my computer. Remember, my request looks like it's coming from my router's IP, which can be accessed by cnn.com because my router's IP is public. So, cnn.com will go ahead and send its response along to my router's IP. After another series of hops, my router will eventually receive today's news from CNN. Now, the router has to forward that response along to the computer that originally made the request, keeping in mind that I could have multiple devices on the same network. The router must therefore maintain an internal table of the IP addresses of all the devices that are using the router to connect to the Internet. Associated with each IP in this table is a <strong>source port</strong>, which is simply a unique number assigned to each device connected to the router. When the router modifies an outgoing request to change the source IP, it also tacks on that device's source port, which then gets sent to CNN. The response from cnn.com will thus also contain the source port attached by NAT, which the router can then use to figure out what device to forward the response to.</p>

<p>Let's make this process a bit more concrete with an example. I'm running a wireless network at home, and my router has an IP of 74.125.226.228. Currently, there are three devices connected to the network, and each has its own private IP. I'm relaxing after a long day, so I make a request from my laptop to 64.208.126.154, which will lead me to reddit.com. My network is using NAT, so here's the state of the world from my router's perspective.</p>

<p>Okay, looks like my laptop has a private IP of 10.0.0.1. Remember, anything in the form <code>10.x.y.z</code> is a private IP address that isn't world-accessible. Once my request reaches the router, its source address will change to that of the router, 74.125.26.228 in this case, and the source port, 1000, will be added to the request. Reddit will eventually receive my request and send back a picture of a cat to the IP address included in the request, which is still 74.125.26.228 with a source port of 1000. Because Reddit sent my impending feline friend to my router's IP address, it will eventually end up at my router. Then, my router can look at the source port attached to the response to look up the private IP the request originated from. Finally, the Reddit data will reach my laptop, and I can enjoy a hearty chuckle. This process certainly sounds pretty involved, but recall how few milliseconds it took to reach Reddit in the United Kingdom!</p>

<p>In order to find out the IP address of a website, we can use a special program called <code>host</code>. If we open up a command prompt on a Mac or Linux machine, we can run the following:</p>

<pre><code>host cnn.com
</code></pre>

<p>This should tell us what the IP addresses that point to cnn.com are. You'll notice that all of these addresses are IPv4 addresses, since each is 4 numbers separated by dots. If we instead type:</p>

<pre><code>host google.com
</code></pre>

<p>One of the last IP addresses output by the <code>host</code> program is an IPv6 address. So, it looks like Google is ready for IPv6, while CNN doesn't appear to be quite yet.</p>

<p>So far, we've taken for granted that a computer connected to the Internet will have an IP address. Let's now take a look at how that number actually gets assigned. As you move among different networks and even as you connect to the same network, your computer's IP address will change. This is a bit different than the computers that power websites like cnn.com, which typically have some mechanism for maintaining the same IP address or set of IP addresses. More on that later, though!</p>

<p><strong>DHCP</strong>, or dynamic host configuration protocol, is commonly used to obtain an IP address on a network. First, a computer that wishes to connect to the network, referred to here as the DHCP client, broadcasts a request to the network with a message that says "Here I am. I'd like to join." Then, a device called the DHCP server (which will eventually be responsible for assigning an IP address to the client) will respond to the client's request, informing the client what its IP is. Now, the client knows exactly where it should send future messages during the process of obtaining an IP address, so it won't needlessly send messages to machines that aren't involved in the process. Next, the client will send another message to the DHCP server, this time formally requesting an IP address on the network. Upon receiving this request, the DHCP server will respond and offer the client an IP address on the network. In the meantime, the server will hold that IP address inside, so no other devices can have it until the client responds. Finally, the client will send one last message to the DHCP server, acknowledging that it has received the IP address and has begun using at. At this point, the client is connected and ready to go!</p>

<p>This process assumes, though, that the DHCP server somehow knows which IP addresses it can assign. For example, a DHCP server in North America needs to ensure that it doesn't assign an IP address that is already in use by a device in Europe. To mitigate this issue, different ranges of IP addresses are allocated to different physical regions of the globe. Here's a map created by the author of <a href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a>, one of my favorite webcomics.</p>

<p><img src="img/6-map.png" alt="Map of the Internet" /></p>

<p>Let's take a closer look. Towards the top of the map, we can see that some organizations have been allocated huge IP ranges. Apple, for example, has all IP addresses in the form <code>17.x.y.z</code>, and MIT has all IP addresses in the form <code>18.x.y.z</code>. The number of IP addresses in those ranges in comparable to the number of IP addresses allocated to entire countries, like Japan's <code>126.x.y.z</code>. From our earlier traceroute output, we can see that my trusty machine in New Jersey has an IP in one of the many ranges allocated to North America. Finally, if you take a look at the right of the map at the <code>192.x.y.z</code> range, you'll see a small dot that says "private." Sure enough, that's referring to the <code>192.168.y.z</code> range that we saw earlier was reserved for private IP addresses!</p>
