Let's hop in our Internet time machine and head back in history to take a look at the development of the Internet. The Internet's humble beginnings can be traced back to the early 1960s and a research project funded by DARPA, an agency of the United States Department of Defense. The project was called **ARPANET**, and it connected machines located at UCLA, Stanford, UCSB, and Utah. In 1969, the first message was transmitted from UCLA to Stanford, and legend has it that the exchange between two programmers located at the universities went something like this:

> Do you see the L?

> Yes, we see the L, came the response. We typed the O, and we asked:

> Do you see the O?

> Yes, we see the O.

> Then we typed the G, and... the system crashed...

> Yet a revolution had begun.

And so, the first message ever transmitted across version 1.0 of the Internet was (somewhat anti-climactically), "lo." Shortly after the first message was successfully sent via ARPANET, a number of other networks began cropping up around the United States. That was all well and good, but since Duke and UNC were connected on a network called UUCPnet and Michigan's universities were connected on a network called Merit, there was no way of communicating _across_ networks. Since computers on different networks used different ways of communicating with each other, a computer on one network couldn't communicate with a computer on another network. So, communication via networks was at first limited to relatively short distances, since these grassroots networks usually developed with the purpose of connecting the computers in a relatively small geographic region.

By the way, you may have heard of what UUCPnet was eventually renamed to: Usenet. Usenet was one of the first Internet discussion systems, where users could post and read news stories via categorized bulletin boards. While Usenet has largely fallen out of mainstream use today, it paved the way for modern staples of the Web, like forums and blogs. Much of Usenet's content has also been archived by Google, and you can now [browse its content](http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html) via Google Groups in your web browser.

Robert E. Kahn of DARPA and Vincent Cerf of Stanford began working on this problem in the early 1970s. In 1973, they released a standard called the **Transmission Control Protocol**, or TCP, which essentially lays out a set of rules that describes how two devices on a network should communicate with each other. As we'll see later, if two networks both rely on TCP to facilitate communication among devices, then devices will be able to communicate across the networks, since both networks are following the same set of rules! In this specification, Kahn and Cerf coined the term "internet," which was short for the word "internetworking," used to describe communication across multiple networks. ARPANET soon adopted this standard, ensuring that all computers connected on the network communicated in the same way. A few years later, this specification evolved into **TCP/IP**, which is the standard communication protocol that devices uses on the Internet today.

In the meantime, ARPANET, still owned by the United States government, continued to grow. In 1970, ARPANET had already expanded all the way to the East Coast, and by the early 1980s, ARPANET connected over 200 computers together. However, usage of ARPANET was limited only to research and government-related communications, and casual chatting was [explicitly prohibited](http://www.academia.edu/1416892/Getting_Started_Computing_at_the_AI_Lab). Inspired by ARPANET, other government organizations like NASA and the NSF (National Science Foundation) began to develop their own networks in the early 1980s. So that these new networks could talk to the existing infrastructure of ARPANET, they were also built on the TCP/IP standard. In 1984, NSFNET, the product of the NSF's research, was interlinked with ARPANET, creating a much larger internetwork that became known as the Internet. Not all networks chose to adopt TCP/IP, though; because Usenet, for example, was instead based on another standard called UUCP, they could not interlink with this new Internet backbone. By the 1980s, the Internet went global, with large networks developed in Europe (like the one built by CERN) and Asia connecting to ARPANET or NSFNET.
